## PacPdf

I needed a quick and simple way to generate test PDF's of variable size.

To this end, I created PacPdf, which is basically an adaptation of the
excellent [example](http://ruby-pdf.rubyforge.org/pdf-writer/demos/index.html)
provided by the pdf-writer people.

Due to some weirdness that I don't have time to sort out, in order to load
pdf-writer you need to `export RUBYOPT=-Ku`
